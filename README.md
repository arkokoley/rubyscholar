# Rubyscholar

# Synopsis

Here is a small script to "scrape" your Google Scholar citations and reformat them (the way I need it for my website). 
Not super flexible - but should be easily customizable.

Some features: 

 * if registered on Crossref, retreives corresponding DOIs and can add altmetric.org links. 
   If Crossref doesn't think your email is valid, no DOIs will be retreived. 
 * adds "Cited by N" for popular papers

# How to use:

### As a Ruby Gem:
1. Install the gem using: `[sudo] gem install rubyscholar`
2. Create and configure a `config.yml` file.
      To create a `config.yml` file, run `$ rubyscholar init`
      Edit the file, filling in your details.
3. Run as `$ rubyscholar scrape --out file.html `.
4. A `file.html` file is created containing your citations all formatted
and ready to use.
5. Done!

### As a ruby script:
1. Configure "config.yml"
   If you want DOI retreival to work (including Altmetrics), you need to be 
   registered at crossref (its free). 
2. Run `ruby bin/scrape.rb` 
3. A scholar.html file is created with your publications from google scholar. 
4. Thats it. 

# Potential for improvement:

 * uses author list as visible on your main Google Scholar page. Sometimes this 
   means names are chopped in two or just a single author is missing. This could
   be made smarter. 
 * flexible output
 * flexible use of DOIs
